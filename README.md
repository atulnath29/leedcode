# 365 Day Code Challenge

## Overview

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is for my 365-day coding challenge. In this challenge, I will be solving one coding problem every day and uploading the solution here. My primary focus will be on platforms like **LeetCode**, and all the solutions will be written in **Java**.

## Challenge Goals

The main goals of this challenge are:

* To improve my problem-solving skills through consistent, daily practice.
* To learn new algorithms and data structures.
* To build discipline and make coding a regular part of my routine.



## How to Contribute
